  The Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle involving three pegs and a set of disks
  of different sizes that must be moved from one peg to another.
  The puzzle requires that only one disk can be moved at a time
  and that no disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
  The goal is to move the entire stack of disks from the source peg
  to the destination peg using the third peg as an auxiliary,
  following these rules. The problem can be solved using a recursive strategy,
  with the minimum number of moves required for n=Number of disks being 2^n-1 moves
  This puzzle illustrates principles of recursion and algorithmic problem-solving.
