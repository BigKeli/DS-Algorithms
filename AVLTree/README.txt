 ==== AVL 1 TASK====

 The provided code implements an AVL tree data structure for
 managing a list of products, each identified by a product ID
 and associated with two prices. The AVL tree ensures that the products
 are stored in a balanced manner, optimizing search, insertion, and deletion operations.
 The program allows users to input multiple products, each with a product ID and two prices.
 It then inserts these products into the AVL tree,
 performing necessary rotations to maintain balance.
  After all products are inserted,
   the code performs an in-order traversal to calculate
   the total price of all products by summing the product of each product ID and its suitable price.
    Finally, it prints the total price.

 ==== AVL2 TASK====
 Similarly to task 1 we use an implementation of AVL Trees with inorder traversal to count
 how many grades are presented from an inserted number of students and counting them using AVL.
